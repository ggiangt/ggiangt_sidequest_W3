## Description

This p5.js project is an interactive story game that demonstrates branching narratives and state management through player choices. "The Dinner Party" places players at a social gathering where they must navigate conversations with three distinct guests (the Host, the Chef, and the Critic). Each conversation offers meaningful choices that affect three tracked stats: secrets discovered, trust earned, and social standing. The game features multiple screens organized across separate files, conditional logic for unlocking different endings based on player performance, and a complete state-based architecture that routes between screens dynamically.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to manage multiple game states using a shared currentScreen variable
- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
- Learn how to route draw(), mousePressed(), and keyPressed() logic based on the active screen
- Build a stat tracking system that persists across multiple screens
- Create conditional branching logic that determines different outcomes based on player choices
- Design a branching narrative structure with meaningful consequences

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.

The code was written with assistance from Claude Code for implementation and Claude Opus for brainstorming and prompt engineering. GenAI helped generate the initial game structure, screen transitions, stat tracking logic, and guest conversation implementations. Human decisions included story concept selection, specific dialogue and character personalities, visual design choices (distinct background colors for each character), and all testing/debugging of game mechanics. GenAI was used iteratively to refine functionality, particularly for fixing stat update issues and improving visual readability.
